=== TO INSTALL ===

Requires: java 1.4 or higher

simply unpack the tar file, which you've likely done if you are reading this.
Optionally, customize the GUI (see below).  You probably want to set 
the location of the pipeline configuration file RPBconfig.xml, the 
backbone queue directory, and the calibration file directory.


=== TO RUN === 

UNIX/LINUX/MAC: 
cd to the directory in which the jar file and configs file are unpacked.
type odrfgui.bat at prompt.

WINDOWS:
browse to the directory where the files were unpacked.
double-click on odrfgui.bat


=== Customizing the GUI ===

A few constants in the GUI can be specified in the odrfgui_cfg.xml.  
Of particular use are the default directories for input, output, logging,
and queue dir.  


  <File paramName="DEFAULT_INPUT_DIR" value="~/osiris/spec_raw/"
    desc="Default raw file directory" />
  <File paramName="DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR" value="~/osiris/spec_orp/"
    desc="Default reduced file directory" />
  <File paramName="DEFAULT_LOG_DIR" value="~/osiris/spec_orp/DRFs/"
    desc="Default reduction log directory" />
  <File paramName="DRF_QUEUE_DIR" value="~/osiris/drf_queue/"
    desc="Default DRP queue directory" />
  <File paramName="DRF_READ_PATH" value="~/osiris/"
    desc="Default path for opening drfs" />
  <File paramName="DRF_WRITE_PATH" value="~/osiris/"
    desc="Default path for writing drfs" />

To override, simply specify the correct path in the value attribute.  
~ can be used for File tags to represent the your home directory.

For conveniece, the calibration directory should be set.  This directory
is used by the GUI to automatically find calibration files for the 
modules that require them, based on the filter and scale of the 
input files.  

  <File paramName="OSIRIS_CALIB_ARCHIVE_DIR"
    value="~/osiris/calib/SPEC"
    desc="OSIRIS Calibration Data Archive" />

Another value that should be set is the location of your pipeline's 
configuration file, RPBconfig.xml.  By default, this file is located
in the backbone/SupportFiles/ directory of the pipeline installation.
The distribution package of this GUI contains the RPBconfig file as
of this release (see date above).  Since this file may change, or may
be customized, it is wise to set the value of this element to the file
used by the pipeline itself to ensure congruency.  This GUI uses that 
file to discover the available modules and information about them.

  <File paramName="OSIRIS_DRP_BACKBONE_CONFIG_FILE" value="RPBconfig.xml"
    desc="Module configuration file for DRP Backbone" />

Additionally, the configuration file provides means to set the default
values for the settings in the Tools->Options dialog.  These are the
boolean tags in the configuration file, such as:

  <boolean paramName="DEFAULT_CONFIRM_DROP_DRF" value="true"
    desc="Default value for whether to confirm dropping DRFs" />

This particular tag specifies whether or not a confirmation dialog is
shown when dropping a DRF.  This can be turned off in the GUI by
unchecking the check box in the Tools->Options dialog next to "Confirm
dropping DRFs to queue", or by clicking the "Don't show this dialog
again" check box on the confirmation dialog.  However, if you know
you don't want this option, and you don't want to have to set this option
everytime you run the GUI, you can override the default setting in the
configuration file by setting the value attribute of the proper tag to
"true" or "false".

Other settings available can be found in ODRFGUIParameters.java.  
This file is provided for reference only.  The GUI does not use the 
code included in this particular copy of the file, since it relies
on a previously compiled version.  Therefore, setting values in this
file will not have any effect.  To override the values of the constants
in this file, set them in the XML config file odrfgui_cfg.xml.

=== Templates ===

This release includes the following reduction templates:

basicARP_drfTemplate.xml: Template for basic ARP reductions, 
  includes Subtract Frame, Adjust Channel Levels, Remove Crosstalk, 
  Glitch Identification, Clean Cosmic Rays, Extract Spectra, 
  Assemble Data Cube, Correct Dispersion, and Save Dataset Information.

basicORP_drfTemplate.xml:  Template for basic ORP reduction, 
  includes Subtract Frame, Adjust Channel Levels, Remove Crosstalk, 
  Glitch Identification, Clean Cosmic Rays, Extract Spectra, 
  Assemble Data Cube, and Save Dataset Information.

fullARP_drfTemplate.xml:  Template for basic ARP reduction with 
  telluric correction and mosaicing multiple frames, with the 
  additional modules Divide by Star Spectrum and Mosaic Frames.

telluricARP_drfTemplate.xml: Template for basic ARP reductions with 
  extracting telluric stars, uses basic ARP modules with 
  Extract Star, Remove Hydrogen Lines, and Divide by Blackbody modules.

combine_skies_darks_drfTemplate.xml: Template for combining multiple 
  dark and sky frames, uses Glitch Identification, and Combine Frames modules.

cubes_mosaic_drfTemplate.xml: Template for mosaicing together 
  already reduced OSIRIS cubes with Mosaic Frames module.

cubes_telluric_correct_drfTemplate.xml: Template for telluric 
  correcting reduced OSIRIS cubes with the Divide by Star Spectrum module.

cubes_telluric_extract_drfTemplate.xml: Template for extracting a 
  1D spectrum of a telluric star from reduced OSIRIS cubes with 
  Extract Star,  Remove Hydrogen Lines, and Divide by Blackbody modules.


=== REVISIONS ===

since 2.2
 - added options to Scaled Sky Module
 - added options to Combine Frames
 - added options to Extract Star

since 2.1: 
  - When removing input files, if there are none left, the working filter 
    and scale are set to None, and the Dataset Name is cleared, if 
    automatically created. 
  - Added support for Scaled Sky Subtraction module, which takes a
    specified file as a calibration file.  Default directory is the
    input file directory.
  - Reordered File menu, and added "New DRF" option, that resets GUI
    to default startup fields (clears input file list, resets reduction type,
    and loads initial template).
  - Added a "Don't show this dialog again" option to the confirmation 
    message when Clear List for input files is hit.  This setting was
    added to the Tools->Options menu.
  - Set default directory for Divide by Star Spectrum to input file directory.
  - When adding input files, the selected files will remain the same as 
    it was before adding the files.  If there was no selection before (e.g. 
    there were no input files), the first input file will be selected.  
    When files are removed, the row of the first removed files will remain
    selected, if the row still exists.  Otherwise, it will select the last
    existing row, if any.
  - Added default values to Tools->Options dialog to odrfgui_cfg.xml for
    easier overriding.

since 2.01: 
  - modified templates that contain Mosaic Frames to not use save 
    dataset module.

since 2.00: 
  - Made calib dir of type File.  
  - Removed subdirs for specific calibration files.  
  - Default dir for Specify a File find file if resolved file not found 
    is input dir for subtract frame, and calibdir otherwise.  
  - Removed Clean Cosmic module from combine_skies_darks_drfTemplate.xml
  - When switching reduction types, remove modules in the active list
    that are not in the new available list.
